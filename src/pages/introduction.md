## Introduction

### Hi! I'm Alan! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a frontend engineer at [Decisiv](https://www.decisiv.com/) where I work with a team to build applications in React. I built and maintain our component library. I also coordinate with our designers to ensure we're delivering a high-quality experience for our customers across all our applications.

### What's this workshop about?

This workshop is designed to provide an understanding of the principles and process of building a component library in React. Together we'll build a library of several small components that can be imported and reused in any React application. By the end of the workshop you should be able to:

* develop extensible components
* organize components in a highly-reusable structure
* test and document components effectively
* publish and version your library

### What we'll build

We'll build a small library of components leading up to a final inline-editable field. We'll start by building the smallest elements and put them all together at the end.

### Expectations

This is an introduction to building a component library in React, and while you're welcome to sit and listen or follow along with someone else, you will get the most out of this workshop by having:

* A laptop (preferrably a Mac)
* Node & npm installed
* A GitHub account
* functional knowledge of Git and GitHub
* functional knowledge of the command-line
* functional knowledge of npm (or Yarn)
* functional knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
* familiar-to-functional knowledge or React
* familiarity with Flexbox grid

### Goals

Upon completing this workshop you should:

* understand why and when a component library is valuable
* have a working knowledge of related tooling and libraries
	* styled-components
	* react-styleguidist
	* BabelJS
	* Yarn / npm
* understand component library structure, principles, and tradeoffs
* understand development process
	* building components
	* writing tests
	* writing docs
	* publishing and versioning your library
* be able to extend this library or build your own

And you should leave with:

* a functional starter library
* helpful links and resources for further learning

### Sections

#### Part I | Overview & Setup

* Discuss why and when component libraries make sense
* Explain goals & what we're building
* View mockups
* Pull down the boilerplate from the repo
* Walk through what we're building (structure & principles)
* Describe various libs and their purpose

#### Part II | Building Elements

We'll start by building a few small Elements:

* Text
* Label
* Icon
* TextField
* TextArea

We'll walk through an effective development workflow as we build. And we'll test and document components as we go.

#### Part III | Building Blocks

Next we'll combine some of those Elements to make Blocks:

* IconButton
* WarningMessage
* InlineEditable

And again, we'll test and document as we go.

#### Part IV | Building Components

And finally, we'll build our InlineEditable Component and add tests and documentation.

#### Part V | Pushing to GitHub and Deployment

We'll wrap up our library by publishing docs to GitHub Pages and deploying to npm (optional).

#### Part VI | Conclusion

We'll conclude the workshop by reviewing what we learned and sharing some helpful links and resources.
