### What Is A Component Library?

A component library is a collection of reusable UI elements. In this context we'll be using React and styled-components, a CSS-in-JS library, but component libraries are by no means limited to a particular implementation.

### Why Are They Useful?

There are a lot of great benefits to having a component library, but the most-commonly noted are:

* UI consistency
* Developer (and often designer) productivity

In short, a component library helps ensure that your UI elements are consistent across all applications. They allow you to provide a high-level of fidelity and predictably and also reduce duplicated effort over time.
